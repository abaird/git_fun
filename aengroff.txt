"And so, does the destination matter? Or is it the path we take? I declare that
 no accomplishment has substance nearly as great as the road used to achieve
 it. We are not creatures of destinations. It is the journey that shapes us.
 Our callused feet, our backs strong from carrying the weight of our travels,
 our eyes open with the fresh delight of experiences lived."

"And if that wasn't funny, there were lots of things that weren't even funnier."

Rice fight, never die
Blue, grey, in the sky
Stand cheer, victory's near
Go go gooooo Rice!
